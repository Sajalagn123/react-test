# Sajal's React Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio I made using react where I have displayed certain projects I would like to serve as examples of my what I can create with the coding skills I have.

I updated the the about me page with my own name and a personal description. 

I added some of my projects to the portfolio section.

I updated the cover image in the header with a new photo, added more projects I worked on in the protfolio section, and changed the CSS as well.

I added an image of myself to the about me page, added project images with a description and project titles, and added a resume link.
